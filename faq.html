			<h1 id="faq">How to Play Roller Derby</h1>
		<section>
			<p>The purpose of the game is to score the most points.  Points are only scored by a Jammer (star on the helmet).  The Jammer acquires 1 point for each opposing team’s blocker/opposing Jammer she passes AFTER she has made an initial pass through all of the blockers otherwise known as the pack.</p>
			<p>A derby game is referred to as a Bout composed a series of plays otherwise known as a Jam.  Each Jam lasts either a full 2 minutes OR less if the Lead Jammer “calls it off” (ends it) by gesturing her hands to her hips.  The Lead Jammer is designated by being the first Jammer to pass all of the opposing blockers.  The benefit to becoming Lead Jammer is that they become able to score points and can end the Jam before the opposing Jammer is able to catch up and score any points.  Often times the Lead Jammer will end the jam immediately if the opposing Jammer is close behind her.      </p>
			<p>At the beginning of each Jam if no players are in the penalty box, each team will have 5 players on the track consisting of 1 Jammer and 4 blockers.  One blocker will have a stripe on her helmet and is called the Pivot acting as the shot caller.  The two Jammers will line up on the Jammer Line.  The blockers can line up anywhere between the Jammer Line and the Pivot Line.  The blockers of both combined teams form the pack.  The blockers must stay within 10 feet of the opposing blockers to maintain the pack or the Ref will call “No Pack” and the Blockers from both teams must come together as quickly as possible to avoid a penalty.  If there is a “No Pack” call, blockers may not obstruct the Jammer and must allow her to pass.  </p>
			<p>Blocking:
The primary purpose of the blockers is to keep the opposing Jammer from getting past them.  In order to stop the Jammer they may get in her way, hip check her, shoulder check her and hopefully knock her out of bounds.  If knocked out of bounds the Jammer MUST come in behind the player that hit her out (unless the player hitting her out falls or also goes out of bounds) along with any other skaters that were ahead of her when she went out of bounds.  This is why you will see opposing blockers skating back once a Jammer is knocked out of bounds.   Blocking may also be Offensive as the blockers will assist their own Jammer by obstructing the opposing team’s blockers.</p>
			<p>Skaters may not: use elbows, trip another skater (low block), use their head/hit another player in the head, block in the back, link together to block (i.e. linking arms would be a multi-player penalty).</p>
